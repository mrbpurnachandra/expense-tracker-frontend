# Expense Tracker
Expense Tracker allows you to record daily expenses. It allows to categorize expenses according to urgency. It also provides visual summary of your expenses and allows you to view summary within any interval.

This app is built as a part of DBMS project. Frontend is built with React and TailwindCSS. Backend is built with NodeJS. I used MySQL as DB.
